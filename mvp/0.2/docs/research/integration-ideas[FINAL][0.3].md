# 🎼 AI-Powered Music App – Backend Integrations (MVP Recommendations)

## 📌 Purpose
This document outlines recommended **backend integrations** and **data pipelines** for an AI-enhanced music-lyrics application. Each integration is self-contained and testable, allowing modular development and later orchestration into the main app. The goal is to demonstrate value early and prepare for scalable implementation.

## 🔧 Technical Integration Points (Testable Modules)

### 1. 🎶 Music Metadata Lookup – `musicbrainz/lastfm`
- **API**: MusicBrainz + Last.fm API (fallback)
- **Tech**: REST API
- **Inputs**: Artist name, track title
- **Outputs**: Album, year, genre, tags, cover art URL, duration
- **Use Cases**:
  - Auto-filling metadata when user pastes a song title
  - Enriching song detail pages with external verified data

---

### 2. 🧠 Audio Analysis – `spotify-features`
- **API**: Spotify Web API – Audio Features
- **Tech**: OAuth 2.0, REST
- **Inputs**: Spotify track URI
- **Outputs**: Tempo (BPM), energy, danceability, valence, key, mode
- **Use Cases**:
  - Adaptive visuals depending on track mood
  - Recommender system for “vibe-based” browsing

---

### 3. 📜 Lyrics + Sync – `musixmatch/lyrics-sync`
- **API**: Musixmatch API (Pro for synced lyrics)
- **Inputs**: Track title, artist name
- **Outputs**: Plain lyrics, LRC timestamped sync, translations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Karaoke mode
  - Displaying multilingual lyrics in dual mode (e.g. PL + ENG)

---

### 4. 🔍 Lyrics Meaning + AI Hints – `genius-annotations`
- **API**: Genius API
- **Inputs**: Song title or Genius ID
- **Outputs**: Lyrics, annotations (explained phrases), web link
- **Use Cases**:
  - AI-enhanced education for understanding lyric meaning
  - Tooltips in karaoke line-by-line explanations

---

### 5. 📈 Waveform Generator – `ffmpeg/waveform-metadata`
- **Libs**: `ffmpeg`, `audiowaveform`, or Node libraries
- **Inputs**: Local or uploaded audio file (MP3, WAV)
- **Outputs**: PNG waveform, JSON peak data
- **Use Cases**:
  - Dynamic background visual
  - Visual progress indicators during playback

---

### 6. 🎧 Music Identification – `audd/acrcloud`
- **API**: ACRCloud or AudD API
- **Inputs**: Audio clip (10–15s)
- **Outputs**: Matched song ID, artist, album, playback links
- **Use Cases**:
  - Passive recognition (like Shazam)
  - Filling in track metadata on upload

---

### 7. 🎼 AI Music Generation (Optional Add-on) – `mubert/soundraw`
- **API**: Mubert or Soundraw.io
- **Outputs**: Royalty-free AI-generated audio
- **Use Cases**:
  - Generating background loops
  - Music composition tool for creators

---

## 💼 Business Value
| Feature | Value Proposition |
|--------|--------------------|
| Karaoke sync | Retention & engagement (active experience) |
| AI meaning tooltips | Differentiator, supports educational angle |
| Mood-based visuals | Emotional connection, shareability |
| Metadata fill-in | Better SEO, less manual input for users |
| Music ID & waveform | UX delight, richer player experience |

---

## 🧩 Suggested Integration Strategy
- Develop each module as a **standalone service** with mock inputs & clear outputs
- Expose as API endpoints via internal gateway
- Later integrate into frontend via GraphQL or BFF (Backend-for-Frontend)
- Run in CI pipelines with stubs until upstream APIs are fully tested

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- [ ] Assign developer leads per module (small squads)
- [ ] Define mock test cases and JSON fixtures
- [ ] Review API rate limits, key scopes, and error responses
- [ ] Schedule design thinking session to explore UX use cases per integration

> Prepared for mid-level devs, solution architects, and product strategy stakeholders.
