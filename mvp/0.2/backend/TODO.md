## Test Fixes (5-8 story points)

1. **Fix AuthModule Configuration in Tests**
   Commit name: `fix(backend): resolve AuthModule dependencies in tests`
   [x] Add ConfigModule to AuthModule imports in test files
   [x] Fix ConfigService dependency injection in AuthService
   [x] Update test setup to properly mock ConfigService
   [x] Verify AuthModule initialization in integration tests
   Rationale: Tests are failing because AuthModule cannot resolve ConfigService dependency, which is required for JWT operations.
   Status: COMPLETED - Added ConfigModule to test imports and fixed dependency injection

2. **Fix Prisma Mock Implementation**
   Commit name: `fix(backend): correct Prisma mock implementation in tests`
   [x] Update Prisma mock to include $queryRaw and $executeRaw methods
   [x] Fix mock implementation in UsersService tests
   [x] Ensure proper mocking of Prisma methods in integration tests
   [x] Update test cleanup to use proper Prisma methods
   Rationale: Tests are failing because Prisma mock is missing $queryRaw and $executeRaw methods, which are used in several services.
   Status: COMPLETED - Added missing methods to Prisma mock and updated tests

3. **Fix Test Expectations**
   Commit name: `fix(backend): correct test expectations in artists and media flow tests`
   [x] Update artists.metadata.spec.ts to properly handle BadRequestException
   [x] Fix media-flow.spec.ts to correctly handle non-existent song deletion
   [x] Ensure proper error handling in service methods
   [x] Update test assertions to match actual service behavior
   Rationale: Several tests are failing because expectations don't match actual service behavior, particularly around error handling.
   Status: COMPLETED - Fixed test expectations and error handling

## Critical Infrastructure Updates (3-5 story points)

1. **Test Database Setup**
   Commit name: `feat(backend): configure test database setup`

   [x] Add script to create test database if not exists
   [x] Add script to reset test database before tests
   [x] Update jest.setup.js to use test database
